I am writing a book titled Practical React. The book is written for software developers who are familiar with React, but not too far along the learning curve. The book consists of 15 or so exercises. The solution to each exercise implements something a React developer should know how to do; for example, debounce input in a text field. The solution resides in its own JavaScript file. Exercises also have a starting point, which is the solution stripped of the code that's essential to the solution. We are going to write the book together. I will give you the description of the exercise and show you the code for the starting point. You will write about the code. Then I will give you the code for the solution, and you will write about that. Initially, I will teach you how to write in my style; for example, I prefer active over passive voice whenever possible.

The target audience is someone who has used React and understands the basics, but does not have a lot of practical experience. Perhaps they have used React on their own, while they do something else at work, or perhaps they are someone who has used React in the past who needs a refresher after a layoff. The book's goals are to improve reader's React skills in general, and to give them practice implementing features that are common to React applications, such as the debouncing I mentioned before, or fetching data from a server. You could also look at each exercise as a "coding challenge", as companies like to call them, that they give to prospective candidates. That's where the exercises come from - they are variations on some coding challenges I was subjected to.

Yes, that is correct. Each exercise has a Start.js and Solution.js files, with the code for the starting point and the solution, respectively. Those JS files are embedded in a React application, so each exercise is the same React application with different Start.js and Solution.js files. In the beginning of the book I am going to cover the implementation of that application. That application is not an exercise, so don't refer to it as such; instead, refer to it as "the exercise application".

That application is not an exercise, so don't refer to it as such; instead, refer to it as "the exercise application". The application consists of several files. We are going to discuss App.js, which contains the application component. That component's markup uses an Instructions component and a DIV that shows either the Start or Solution component. The Instructions component, in turn, uses an InstructionsIcon component that displays a different icon for each exercise, and an InstructionsText exercise that contains the exercise's description.
