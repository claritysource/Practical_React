    <h1 class='basic'>Extracting Components</h1> 
      <p>
        This is a React functional component that implements an interactive exercise or tutorial. It uses the useState hook from the React library to manage the visibility of the solution.
      </p>
        The component has three child components: Instructions, Start, and Solution. The Instructions component displays the title of the exercise and a button to toggle the visibility of the solution.
        The main content of the exercise is displayed in the work-area div. Depending on the value of solutionVisible, either the Solution component or the Start component is displayed.
        When the button in the Instructions component is clicked, the value of solutionVisible is toggled, which updates the visibility of the solution.
        Finally, the component is exported as the default export.

    <h2 id='start'>The Solution</h2> 
      <p>The <code>Solution</code> component for this coding exercise is shown in the following listing.</p>
      <pre id='sec1-1'>
      .selected-user {
        margin-bottom: 1em;
      }

      .dropdown-label {
        margin-right: 1em;
      }
      </pre>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>In this coding exercise we discussed extracting a component from an existing component's markup. That extraction is a commonplace task for React developers.</p>
<p>Extracting components results in many benefits, including the creation of a general component that can be reused in many different domain-specific situations.</p>
